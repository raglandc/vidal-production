## The problem I came across

I have built my websites blog with nextJS and Typescript. Instead of storing my blog articles in a database I store them locally in markdown files.

There are other alternative markdown librarys that developers can use to create awesome markdown files, however I ended up going with Markdown-to-jsx.

A super lightweight and flexible NPM package that doesnt require a bunch of other hocus pocus or configuring that config file. Sweet!
