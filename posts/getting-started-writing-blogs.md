## The problem I came across

I have built my website, the one you are probably reading this on, with nextJS and Typescript. Instead of storing my blog articles in a database I store them locally in markdown files.

One of the amazing features of Next, is it comes with a few pre-built components.

The one I will use today is the Image component.
