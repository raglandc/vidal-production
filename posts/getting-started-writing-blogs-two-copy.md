## Reason One: Server Side Rendering

I think alot of us can agree that we love React, thank you Facebook. However, one problem we get with vanilla React, is all of the code stays on the client side.

Which is fine... but what if we want to run some code that we dont want the client to see?

Well we could use a third party for some backend code, but wait!

NextJS comes out-of-the-box with server side rendering. We can exicute code on both the client side as well as the server side. Now thats what im talking about.

## Reason Two: Folder Routing

Usually with React if we want to create paths for each of our pages we use a package with React called "react-router" which gives us the ability to hack our way around this obsticle.

Yet, with NextJs this is built in to how you structure your files.

Thats right, the way you structure your files in your next Next project (see what I did there? ðŸ˜‰ ) will define how the url changes as you navigate the application.

Thats pretty awesome if you ask me. You also have the ability for dynamic routing which is a topic for another day because it is a bit out of this scope of this article.

## Reason Three: SEO

When we normally build websites for a small buisness SEO is critical. If they are trying to sell a product, then it is important that search engines know about what is on their website and it will connect the customer to their site by crawling the page and finding that information.

Normally with vanilla React, all the code is client side and all the code is written in JSX and stored in files until it is displayed to the user.

As stated earlier, NextJs is server side and has the ability to pre-render some important things that the crawlers of search engines will have no trouble finding out what your website is all about and connect the customer to exaclty what they're looking for.

### In Conclusion

There are plenty of options when it comes to building web applications. Infact, it seems like everyday there is a new javascript framework being created.

I suggest you consider NextJs as a tool to add to your arsenol. Things change all the time in the world of tech and while there is no telling what could be right around the corner. However, I do belive Next is one that is here to stick around for many reasons. More than what I described today, this was just a little icing from the cake.

Until Next time my friends, have fun!
